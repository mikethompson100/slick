This project contains Slick js carousel examples based off of Ken Wheeler's library here:
https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/

I will be teaching myself slick over the next month or so, learning all of the different features and applying them to the examples that I create. 


Notes: 12/18/22 - Refactored the code to consolidate repetitive lines like the carousel image tags and slick calls. After doing that, I also needed to create an asynchronous function to make sure that the slick carousels ran after the dynamic image code ran so slick had elements to act upon.
 
 Notes: 1/2/23: Replaced the javascript that looped through each carousel to activate it with individual calls using the slick data from the HTML data-slick attribute of each carousel.
Still in the process of converting over all carousels, at Carousel 6/7.
